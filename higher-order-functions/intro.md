# Higher Order Functions

“We hosted a birthday party” is an abstraction that may build on the abstraction “We made a cake.”

Notice how we assign 'announceThatIAmDoingImportantWork' without parentheses as the value to the busy variable. We want to assign the value of the function itself, not the value it returns when invoked.

In JavaScript, functions are first class objects. This means that, like other objects you’ve encountered, JavaScript functions can have properties and methods.

A higher-order function is a function that either accepts functions as parameters, returns a function, or both!
